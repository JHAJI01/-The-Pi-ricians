# COVID-19 Data Analysis

This repository contains a dataset of COVID-19 statistics and a project to analyze it using Python and various data analysis techniques. The project validates **Benford’s Law** and **Zipf’s Law** on the COVID-19 data and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract meaningful insights.

## Project Overview..

The main objective of this project is to:-

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a real-world COVID-19 dataset.
- Validate **Benford’s Law** and **Zipf’s Law** using the COVID-19 data.
- Provide insights into the COVID-19 statistics, including cases, deaths, and recoveries across different countries.

### Key Tasks:-

- **Data Cleaning**: Remove missing values, handle outliers, and ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
- **EDA**: Visualize trends, distributions, and relationships between various COVID-19 statistics.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Validate Benford’s Law (for leading digit distribution) and Zipf’s Law (for frequency of occurrence).
- **Visualization**: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create meaningful visualizations of the data.
